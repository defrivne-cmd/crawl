1. Managed Browsers: Your Digital Identity Solution
---------------------------------------------------

**Managed Browsers** let developers create and use **persistent browser profiles**. These profiles store local storage, cookies, and other session data, letting you browse as your **real self**—complete with logins, preferences, and cookies.

### Key Benefits

* **Authentic Browsing Experience**: Retain session data and browser fingerprints as though you’re a normal user.
* **Effortless Configuration**: Once you log in or solve CAPTCHAs in your chosen data directory, you can re-run crawls without repeating those steps.
* **Empowered Data Access**: If you can see the data in your own browser, you can automate its retrieval with your genuine identity.
